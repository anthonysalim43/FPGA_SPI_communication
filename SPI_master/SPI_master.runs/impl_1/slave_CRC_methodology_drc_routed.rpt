2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
TIMING-27#1 Critical Warning
Invalid primary clock on hierarchical pin  
A primary clock clk_wiz_inst/inst/clk_in1 is created on an inappropriate internal pin clk_wiz_inst/inst/clk_in1. It is not recommended to create a primary clock on a hierarchical pin when its driver pin has a fanout connected to multiple clock pins
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#1 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -1.064 ns between bit_counter_reg[2]/C (clocked by clk_out1_clk_wiz_0) and bit_counter_reg[20]/CE (clocked by clk_out1_clk_wiz_0). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#2 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -1.072 ns between bit_counter_reg[3]/C (clocked by clk_out1_clk_wiz_0) and rx_buffer_reg[1]/CE (clocked by clk_out1_clk_wiz_0). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#3 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -1.109 ns between bit_counter_reg[3]/C (clocked by clk_out1_clk_wiz_0) and rx_buffer_reg[2]/CE (clocked by clk_out1_clk_wiz_0). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#4 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -1.201 ns between bit_counter_reg[3]/C (clocked by clk_out1_clk_wiz_0) and rx_buffer_reg[0]/CE (clocked by clk_out1_clk_wiz_0). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#5 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -1.206 ns between bit_counter_reg[3]/C (clocked by clk_out1_clk_wiz_0) and rx_buffer_reg[3]/CE (clocked by clk_out1_clk_wiz_0). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
